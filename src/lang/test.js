Some people remain in silence while others start crying.\n\nA lot of questions come to mind such as “when will I die?”, “how did that happen?”, “why me?” or “should I continue making plans?”.\n\nPeople living with HIV still cannot talk about it freely with their peers, friends and family due to fear.\n\nFear of being misunderstood, fear of being misjudged, fear of not knowing how the other would react.\n\nHIV is a secret which makes the patient suffer silently.\n\nThe solely purpose of this app is to educate the readers."

            first: "Avert.org says “HIV crossed from chimps to humans in the 1920s in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. This was probably as a result of chimps carrying the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), a virus closely related to HIV”. And History.com adds SIV “jumped to humans when hunters in Africa ate infected chimps, or the chimps’ infected blood got into the cuts or wounds of hunters”.\n\nA lot of people think HIV/AIDS started in 1980s and that is because it came to public attention when first cases appeared in Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco, in the United States of America.",

            second: "Below are some extracts of facts related to HIV/AIDS in chronological order. Full history of HIV/AIDS and corresponding references are from Avert.org (2019).\n\nA group of five young gay men in Los Angeles were diagnosed with a lung cancer in 1981.\n\nThe syndrome was named Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (GRID) – gay cancer – because, in June 1982, cases were confined to gay men only.\n\nHowever in September 1982, CDC4 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) adopted the term ‘AIDS’ (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and it described as “a disease at least moderately predictive of a defect in cell mediated immunity, occurring in a person with no known case for diminished resistance to that disease.”\n\nIn January 1983, female partners of men were being reported suggesting that AIDS was not among gay community only. And in June of the same year, children started being diagnosed as well. In September, CDC stated transmission are not by “casual contact, food, water, air or surfaces”.\n\nAnother announcement made by CDC in July 1984 was about “avoiding injecting drug use and sharing needles ‘should also be effective in preventing transmission of the virus’”.\n\nIn May 1986, the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses stated the cause of AIDS is officially named HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).\n",
            third: "\nThe first HIV treatment drug was launched in March 1987 named zidovudine (AZT). Also, in July of the same year, WHO5 confirmed breastfeeding can transmit HIV.\n\nFirst of December was declared as the World AIDS Day by WHO in 1988.\n\nIn October 1990, AZT was approved for HIV treatment in children by the FDA.\n\nIn other to prevent HIV mother-to-child transmission, the USA Public Health Service suggested AZT in August 1994. And in December of the same year, an oral HIV test was approved by FDA.\n\nA breakthrough took place when in June 1995 the first protease inhibitor, which prevents the virus from replicating, was approved by the FDA. A new era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) began and there was a rate decline in deaths and hospitalization caused by AIDS of around 60% to 80%.\n\nAdvocating for global action on the epidemic, the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS – UNAIDS – was founded in 1996.\n\nIn September 1997, the FDA announced Combivir which was a combination of two drugs, facilitating users to take their medication daily.\n\nThe fourth biggest cause of death worldwide was by AIDS. In Africa, this was the first cause. That was announced by the WHO in 1999.\n\nUNAIDS was able to negotiate the reduction of antiretroviral prices for developing countries with five pharmaceutical companies in July 2000.\n\nIn November 2002, the first rapid HIV test was approved by the FDA. This test offers 99.6% accuracy result in 20 minutes.\n\nAccording to ourworlddata.org, the peak of deaths from HIV/AIDS occurred in 2005 and 2006 claiming 1.95 million lives from each year.\n\nIn 2010, the use of PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) treatment as a trial to reduce HIV transmission among men who have sex with other men proved to be successful by 44%.\n\nIn 2011, it was confirmed a reduction by 96% of transmission between HIV-positive and HIV-negative couples by those who had started antiretroviral treatments.\n\nIn 2012, the FDA approved PrEP to HIV-negative people as a form to stop HIV spreading.\n\nA report published by UNAIDS was released in 2013 stating the AIDS-related deaths had been dropped by 30% since the peak in 2005 and 2006.\n\nIn September 2015, the WHO began recommending every new diagnosed person should start antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible. Before that, only individuals whose CD4 were less than 200 cells received treatment. Less than 200 CD4 cells means AIDS diagnosis.\n\nFor the first time in 2017, more than half of the HIV-positive world population have access to antiretroviral treatment. That corresponds to 19.5 million people. Also, in the same year, worldwide organizations launched a campaign called “Undetectable = Untransmittable” (U=U) in order to suppress stigma.",

            first: "When a person is newly diagnosed, he/she soon finds out what CD4 and Viral Load8 are. These two terms need to be inserted into the patient’s vocabulary due to their importance in the HIV treatment.\n\nAs you already know, HIV is a virus and it attacks a very specific cell in our organism known as CD4 which is part of our immune system. This attack is vital for HIV because it cannot replicate itself so it needs CD4 to do the job.\n\nCD4 cells are little, yet, powerful soldiers which offer protection in our bodies. They are white blood cells that help fight infections and diseases.\n",
            subtitle: "HIV life cycle",
            second: "Below, you can see the the virus life cycle",
            third: "1. HIV virus attaches itself on the surface of a CD4 cell.\n2. Once attached, it releases its RNA which is a genetic material such as DNA and other enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and integrase.\n3. The reverse transcriptase will convert RNA (in yellow) to DNA (in red).\n4. The new HIV DNA enters the CD4 nucleus and attaches itself to CD4 DNA (in blue) using integrase enzyme.\n5. Now, HIV is able to replicate using CD4 mechanisms. The result of the replication is HIV proteins (in green).\n6. HIV proteins move to the surface of CD4 and assembles into new harmless and young HIV virus.\n7. The new harmless HIV will leave the CD4 cell. It will mature and infect other CD4 cells.\n\nThe example above shows only one replication which, in reality, HIV keeps on replicating multiple times until CD4 cell realizes there is nothing else to be done and ‘commits suicide’. When CD4 dies, young HIV virus are released. So, it is very important to keep track about the amount of CD4 in the bloodstream.\n\nAccording to Aaron Moncivaiz et at. (2018), a person who is HIV negative may have a CD4 count anywhere between 500 and 1600 cells per cubic millimetre of blood (cells/mm3). However, a diagnosis of AIDS occurs when the CD4 count drops lower than 200 cells cell/mm3. At this stage, the immune system is very weak to fight off diseases so the individual falls ill.",
